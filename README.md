# ML-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-LetsUpgrade
Training a model to predict breast cancer and comparing the  4 models' accuracy 
We have used 4 Machine Learning Models:
1. Logistic Regression Method        acc:98.24%
2. Decision tree Classifier Method   acc:98.24%
3.Random Forest Classifier Method    acc:98.24%
4. Support Vector Classifier Method  acc:98.24%

This was made in LetsUpgrade ML project bootcamp that was held for 2 days
